# Work Day Scheduler
A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day.

## Overview
Keeping track of a busy schedule can be difficult. This simple calendar application  allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was used to work with dates and times. Note: `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers.
