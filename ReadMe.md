# Application Details

## Purpose

This app was developed to help the user track the events throughout their workday. 

## Description

Keeping track of a busy schedule can be difficult. This simple calendar application  allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. 

For user's convenience, the current time is identified with red, past events with grey and upcoming appointments with green. Save button to the right of each item can be used to save the initial entry or its modification.

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library was used to work with dates and times. Note: `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers.

Ideas for future development include:
1. Option to extend work hours
2. Block out certain times as personal time
3. Add alerts when an appointment is approaching
